lxd-openwrt-simplified
===========

Scripts for building LXD/LXC images from OpenWrt rootfs tarballs. 

This is a simplified version of https://github.com/mikma/lxd-openwrt.

This version assumes the user has already got an OpenWRT 19.07 or later rootfs tarball containing ALL essential packages, e.g. by buildroot or by image builder.

What it will do:

1. unpack the tarball provided by the user.

2. build metadata and inject container-specific files/settings.

3. repack the tarball according to lxc/lxd requirements. 

Requirements
------------

It's recommended you use Debian or Ubuntu on the build system. 
* fakeroot is needed. Or user can config the script to use sudo.

Configuration
-------------

Refer to the top of build_cust.sh.

Usage
-----

./build_cust.sh <rootfs tarball> <lxd|plain>

Example
-------

./build_cust.sh openwrt-snapshot-r13592-x86-64-generic-rootfs.tar.gz plain
